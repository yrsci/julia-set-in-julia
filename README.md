# julia-set-in-julia
An exercise in writing Julia: two different approaches to generating Julia sets. 

One uses a simple for loop to iterate through a lattice and generate the set; the other uses matrix multiplication. There is a choice of three constants (stored in a dictionary); each will lead to generation of a different Julia set.

In each, a portable bitmap image file (.pbm) is produced and saved to the same directory.
